# Snake-Game
Here the player has to move a snake so it touches the fruit. If the snake touches itself or the border of the game then the game will over
## How to play
- If the Up key will press then the snake will move in up direction.
- If the Down key is pressed then the snake will move in the down direction.
- If Left key will press then the snake will move in left direction.
- If the Right key will press then the snake will move in the right direction

  If the snake touches the fruit then the fruit will go at any random position and score will increase and the size of the snake will also increase.
  If the snake touches the border of the game then the game will over.
